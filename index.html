subtitle: Making zsh comfortable

pagecontent:
  what: myzsh provides a configuration framework customizing the zsh prompt.
  how: myzsh installs everything into a single directory. A variable and a call to the init script is all that's needed.
  prefix: myzsh won’t install files outside its prefix, and you can place a myzsh installation wherever you like.
  createpackages: Trivially create your own myzsh modules.
  formula: myzsh modules are simple zsh scripts.
  complement: myzsh complements commands by extending their usage.
  install:
    install: Install myzsh 
    paste: Paste that at a Terminal prompt.
    what: The script explains what it will do and then pauses before it does it. There are more installation options <a href='https://github.com/myzsh/myzsh/wiki/Installation'>here</a> (needed on 10.5).
